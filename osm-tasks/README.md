# OsmTasksBackend

## Prerequisites

The program requires `rust` and `cargo`.
An installation of rust and cargo, is described in this [guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Since the program uses rocket, a nightly build of rust is required to build the program.
A nightly version of rust, can be installed via `rustup default nightly`. Additional information about how to install a nightly build can be found at the [Rocket Guide](https://rocket.rs/v0.4/guide/getting-started/).

## Setup
To build the program you can either use `cargo build --release` to compile the program.
Afterward the binary can started with `./target/release/osm-tasks <OSM coastlines file> -b -n <node number>`

Alternatively the program can be started directly via cargo. To do so, use the command:

`cargo run --release -- <OSM coastlines file> -b -n <node number>`.

## Command line Arguments

The program supports a few command line arguments.
Use `--help` to show all available command line arguments:
```
USAGE:
    osm-tasks [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <coastlines-file>

ARGS:
    <coastlines-file>    Coastlines file used to generate the polygons

FLAGS:
    -b, --build-graph-on-startup    Build graph on startup. Sets wether the graph generation should
                                    be triggered at startup. Generation trough REST API will be
                                    available anyway
    -f, --force-rebuild-graph       Set this if the graph should be generated from scratch. If this
                                    is not set, the program will try to load an already generated
                                    graph of the form <coastlines_file>.<number_of_nodes>.bin
    -h, --help                      Prints help information           
    -V, --version                   Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -g, --geojson-export-path <geojson-export-path>
            Path to save the exported geoJSON file with the generated polygons, if the polygons
            should be exported. If no file is specified, the file is not generated

    -n, --nodes <number-of-nodes>
            Number of points which will equaly distributed over the sphere. Each point outside of a
            polygon will generate a node in the graph. So this is the upper bound for the number of
            nodes in the graph [default: 10000]
```
Use the '-n <node number>' to set the number of nodes used for building the graph.
After building the graph, the program will save the graph to disk into a file with the name `<coastlines_file>.<number_of_nodes>.bin`, which will be loaded at further program starts, if the same number of nodes and the same coastlines file (name) is used (unless the `-f` flag is used to ignore the file and rebuild the graph).

## REST API

The API is documented automatically at `http://localhost:8000/swagger-ui/index.html`.

### OpenAPI Specification

We used [OpenAPI 3](https://swagger.io/specification/) to specify the API interfaces between the backend and the frontend. The specification file can be found at `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json`. The file is used to generate stubs for the frontend and to document the REST API automatically.

## Notes on Contraction Hierarchies

The implementation provided on the main branch is not optimal and still contains some errors when producing shortcuts, e.g. shortcuts are not created between neighbors of the contracted node but between all nodes in the independent set.

An alternative implementation exists on the `ch` branch. This implementation creates shortcuts between neighbors and is faster compared to the other algorithms. However, the calculated results are not always correct.
